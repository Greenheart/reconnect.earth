## Reclaim

### What this means

-   to reclaim our attention
-   to reclaim our agency - we're citizens rather than mere consumers.
-   to reclaim our time and energy
-   this needs to happen both individually and collectively
-   Refer to a resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs

### Why it is important to Reclaim

-   to create space for the deeper cultural and economic transformation we need to make in order to handle the metacrisis.
-   so we can thrive in life while doing good in the world. We must start with self-compassion before we can widen our circles of compassion to others, our communities, bioregions and the world.
-   so you can choose what you want - rather than what others want you to choose
-   The more we reclaim, the more we can widen our circles of compassion from self to others to the whole living Earth.
-   For Reconnect.earth, I imagine people coming together to support each other in order to reclaim time, energy, attention and ultimately their socioeconomic conditions and their agency. Basically to first free each other and create conditions for their own wellbeing, and then unlock their creative potential to engage further and make change happen at a more structural level in their communities. This could be an activity to reflect on what you need, and then deciding on concrete actions you can take to improve your situation, together.

### Why it is important to Reflect

## Reconnect

### What this means

-   Realise that the world is interconnected (refer to systems thinking as a source)
-   Reconnect with yourself: feel your body. recognise your feelings and your needs to thrive in life. Reconnect with what gives you meaning.
-   Reconnect with other people, both locally and globally
-   Reconnect with other living beings
-   Reconnect with the living planet

### Why it is important to Reconnect

-   Many of the world's problems today stem from a deep disconnection - from ourselves, from other people (both locally and globally), and from the living planet.
-   realise that not all "needs" are actual needs, but things that have been imposed on us via advertising and behavioural manipulation (förklara ord + källa!) social media
-   reconnect to other people to recognise their needs
-   meaning in life --> societal flourishing (source)

## Reimagine

### What this means

-   imagine a positive future
-   iteratively design & prototype & experiment the new world, ex: used deep design of business to redesign our organisations to be regenerative and distributive by design

### Why it is important to Reimagine

-   Re-imagine is critical for us in order to explore and envision new ways of being, thinking, organizing and living.
-   vision principle - focus on what you want to create instead of what you want to avoid. + more motivating
-   a vision/goal makes us unconsciously to work towards it (example from elite sportspeople)
-   We must re-imagine before we can regenerate. Or more accurately, we need to embrace this iterative process and constantly re-imagine as we learn more. Continue exploring the branches of the framework as we live and learn.

### How you can practice

-   think about/ describe in written (list/ text/ poem/ song)/ make an artwork (2D/ 3D) of your positive vision - and share it if you want

### Relevant resources to learn more

-   Phoebe Tickell (?)
-   stories.life

### Relevant activities to practice

-   simply develop your positive vision

## Regenerate

### What this means

-   make something better (not only sustain/ sustainable) - for yourself, for others and/or for the living planet. Need to change the economy and culture, among others.
-   create what you have imagined
-   iterative process - need to keep reflecting, reimagining nad regenerating
-   do it yourself or together with others in your community/organisation
-   ripples on the water (eller annan liknelse)

### Why it is important to Regenerate

-   world is becoming worse
-   not enough to reduce our negative footprint, but need to increase our positive handprint
-   sustainable is not enough
-   if we can do regeneration on all levels (individual, in communities, for the living planet)- get positive feedback loops - by regenerating on all levels, by definition, we strengthen the capacity to do even more positive things in the future (as long as we maintain a healthy balance and support each other)
-   we cannot rely on unpaid engagement to make everything happen - people need to live (har pengar för att klara sig). Social entrepreneurship: we need to organise economically to create movements that are regenerative and can increase the impact over time. But: not business - according to deep design of business so that as much as possible stays within the business. We need new ideals and ideas of what social entrepreneurship means. It's not about getting rich, but to live well and do good in the world while giving as much as possible to support further regernerative efforts.

### How you can practice this

-   embody the change & generative social fields. It matters how we show up.
-   live regenerative & distributive

### Relevant resources to learn more

-   gift economy & abundance economy
-   commoning, https://www.commonerscatalog.org/

-   democratic economy

### Relevant activities to practice

-   could be anything!

# The Reconnect.earth process (on the detailed page)

Many problems in today's world arise from disconnection - from ourselves, each other, and from the living Earth. Up until now, efforts to tackle these issues have unfortunately been focused on the symptoms of the metacrisis, rather than the underlying causes.

We need a more systematic approach and we need to reconnect to what matters. We can redefine what it means to be an active citizen, prioritising wellbeing on all levels while using more potent leverage points to more effectively respond to the metacrisis.

---

Change starts within and is both personal and collective. By collaborating, we empower ourselves and each other to thrive in life while doing good in the world - very similar to how trees in the forest work together to create resilient and healthy ecosystems.

There are five branches of learning and practice to help turn the metacrisis from an abstract threat into actionable pathways towards a better future.

---

The Reconnect.earth process is both personal and collective:

-   Personal - as we engage with the five branches of the Reconnect.earth process, we grow like trees. Both by creating a stable foundation for our wellbeing through our root systems, and by growing our branches as we flourish in life.

-   Collective - just like the wellbeing of a forest requires a healthy ecosystem with many connected trees and mycelial networks, _local, bioregional and planetary wellbeing_ can emerge when we support each other, collaborate and connect our networks.

Just like trees extend their interconnected root systems, growing into resilient forests, people reconnect to what matters, support each other to thrive in life and do good in the world. As this process unfolds, we create conditions for the emerging wellbeing economy that is regenerative and distributive by design.

---

### TODO: Add humane tech, doguhnut, platform co-op free software to the app and tech collection section (and dedicated page)

Our guiding question is: What if humane technology was the norm, designed to empower connection, reflection and regenerative and distributive action?

---

---

### Other ideas for background info page

-   Collectvively, because just like the wellbeing of a forest requires a healthy ecosystem with many collaborating trees and mycelial networks, planetary wellbeing could emerge from communities of practice, extending networks of co-operation and reciprocity.

widen our circles of compassion - to create conditions for even more people to thrive in life whlie doing good in the world

What if we could extend this forest to the whole earth?
