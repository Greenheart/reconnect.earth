## Reimagine

### What this means

-   imagine a positive future
-   iteratively design & prototype & experiment the new world, ex: used deep design of business to redesign our organisations to be regenerative and distributive by design

### Why it is important to Reimagine

-   Re-imagine is critical for us in order to explore and envision new ways of being, thinking, organizing and living.
-   vision principle - focus on what you want to create instead of what you want to avoid. + more motivating
-   a vision/goal makes us unconsciously to work towards it (example from elite sportspeople)
-   We must re-imagine before we can regenerate. Or more accurately, we need to embrace this iterative process and constantly re-imagine as we learn more. Continue exploring the branches of the framework as we live and learn.

### How you can practice

-   think about/ describe in written (list/ text/ poem/ song)/ make an artwork (2D/ 3D) of your positive vision - and share it if you want

## Regenerate

### What this means

-   make something better (not only sustain/ sustainable) - for yourself, for others and/or for the living planet. Need to change the economy and culture, among others.
-   create what you have imagined
-   iterative process - need to keep reflecting, reimagining nad regenerating
-   do it yourself or together with others in your community/organisation
-   ripples on the water (eller annan liknelse)

### Why it is important to Regenerate

-   world is becoming worse
-   not enough to reduce our negative footprint, but need to increase our positive handprint
-   sustainable is not enough
-   if we can do regeneration on all levels (individual, in communities, for the living planet)- get positive feedback loops - by regenerating on all levels, by definition, we strengthen the capacity do do even more positive things in the future (as long as we maintain a healthy balance and support each other)
-   we cannot rely on på unpaid engagement to make everything happen - people need to live (har pengar för att klara sig). Social entrepreneurship: we need to organise economically to create movements that are regenerative and can increase the impact over time. But: not business - according to deep design of business so that as much as possible stays within the business. We need new ideals and ideas of what social entrepreneurship means. It's not about getting rich, but to live well and do good in the world while giving as much as possible to support further regernerative efforts.

### How you can practice this

-   embody the change & generative social fields. It matters how we show up.
-   live regenerative & distributive
